Affective computation is a recent area of the artificial intelligence
that aims to improve the interactive processes between emotional agents and the human,
both for software and hardware applications.
Currently the scientific community makes efforts to apply existing theories in
multiagent systems by potential applications in this area.
Different authors study emotional models in order to improve interaction between intelligent agents,
an example is the affective model of MASOES,
although this affective model has been formally verified at the design level,
it has not been verified at the implementation level.
In light of the above, this paper proposes an implementation of the MASOES affective model on a multiagent system,
in order to provide an environment for the interaction between the emotional processes and the different functions of an agent.
In addition, the calculation of the Social Emotion is proposed,
allowing to describe the collective emotional state of a group of emotional agents.
To achieve this, a multiagent system was designed and developed based on the JADE framework,
which uses the FIPA standard to develop universal agents.
Finally, the implemented was applied on a case of study using simulations
to generate individual and collective emotions,
and the results were compared at the implementation level with those obtained by \cite{perozo2011} at the design level.
